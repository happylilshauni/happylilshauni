 Hi, I’m @happylilshauni. My name is Shauna but I have been going by nickname Shauni most recently.
 I’m interested in tech sales, plant based cooking, self-growth and self-awareness, travel, music and adventure. 
 I’m currently learning about meditation from Jay Shetty's Genius community program. I listen to his podcast weekly and have begun meditating regularly. 
 I’m looking to collaborate on website development and sharing recipes. 
 How to reach me ... you can email me shaunamsweeney@gmail.com
